# Functional Diagrams: Hardware

## About

These diagrams represent how different VotingWorks systems function.  They are meant to document systems in a variety of contexts, including:

* The abstract functions or behaviors of systems, ignoring specific parts
* User actions (or activities or behaviors), when they are using a system
* Ideas for design and redesign
* Final designs
* Helping identify failure modes

These are coded with [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/).
